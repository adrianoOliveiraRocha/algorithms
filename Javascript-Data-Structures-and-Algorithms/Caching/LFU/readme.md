<h1>Least Frequently Used Caching</h1>
Least frequently used (LFU) caching is a caching algorithm used by the operating system to manage memory. The system tracks the number of times a block is referenced in memory. By design, when the cache exceeds its limit, the system deletes the item with the lowest reference frequency. The easiest implementation
of the LFU cache is assigning a counter to every block loaded into the cache and incrementing a counter every time a reference is made to that block. When the cache exceeds its limit, the system searches for the block with the lowest counter and
removes it from the cache.
