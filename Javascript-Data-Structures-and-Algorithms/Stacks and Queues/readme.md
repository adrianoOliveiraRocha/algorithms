<h1>Stacks and Queues</h1>
<p>
This chapter covers stacks and queues; both are versatile data structures commonly used
in the implementation of other, more complex data structures. You will learn what stacks
and queues are, how and when they are used, and how to implement them. Finally, the
exercises will help you to understand these concepts as well as when to apply stacks and
queues to an algorithmic problem.
