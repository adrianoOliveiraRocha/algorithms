DESIGN A CASHIER CLASS THAT TAKES IN A CUSTOMER OBJECT AND 
HANDLES FOOD ORDERING ON A FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVED BASIS

Here are the requirements:
1.	The cashier requires a customer name and order item for 
the order.
2.	The customer who was served first is processed first.

Here are the required implementations:
• addOrder(customer): Enqueues a customer object to be 
processed by deliverOrder()
• deliverOrder(): Prints the name and order for the next 
customer to be processed
