<h1>2. Graph of the 1st degree function</h1>
<p>The geometric representation of the 1st degree function is a straight line,
Therefore, to determine the graph it is necessary to obtain two
points. In particular, we will look for the points where the line crosses
the x and y axes.</p>
<p>In general, given the function f(x) = ax + b, to determine the intersection of the straight line with the axes, proceed as follows:</p>


* points [(â€“ b/a , 0), (0, b)]

* f(x) is increasing if a is a positive number (a > 0);
* f(x) is decreasing if a is a negative number (a < 0);
