Complete the method so that it returns an array of all ID's passed in. The data structure will be similar to the following:

var data = {
  id: 1,
  items: [
    {id: 2},
    {id: 3, items: [
      {id: 4},
      {id: 5}
    ]}
  ]
}

extractIds(data) // should return [1,2,3,4,5]
The method should be able to handle the case of empty data being passed in.

Note: The only arrays that need to be traversed are those assigned to the "items" property.
